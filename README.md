# Data Storage Finder

A simple, Cornell-style data storage finder: describe your data with filters, select services, and compare them in a table. Content is derived from **KD#1_ Data Storage Matrix.xlsx**.

Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript so it can be hosted on any static server (e.g. GitHub Pages, S3, Netlify, or `npx serve`).

## Quick start (no build)

1. **Option A – Use pre-built JSON**  
   From the project root run once:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build-data
   ```
   This reads `KD#1_ Data Storage Matrix.xlsx` and writes `app/data/services.json`.

2. **Option B – Load Excel in the browser**  
   Copy the Excel file into the app folder with a URL-safe name:
   ```bash
   cp "KD#1_ Data Storage Matrix.xlsx" app/Data_Storage_Matrix.xlsx
   ```
   The app will load it at runtime via SheetJS (CDN). No Node or build step required.

3. **Serve the app**
   ```bash
   npx serve app -l 3000
   ```
   Or host the `app/` folder on any static host. Open the URL (e.g. http://localhost:3000).

## Excel format

- **Row 1:** Headers. First column = service name; remaining columns = criteria (e.g. Max Size, Backup, Cost).
- **Row 2+:** One row per storage option; cells match the headers.

The finder turns each column (except the first) into a filter dropdown and builds the comparison table from the selected services.
